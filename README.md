# pictura-poem-to-image-generator

Our project focuses on the creation of a poem-to-image generator, utilising a stable diffusion model refined through the DreamBooth framework. This system takes a poem as input and produces a collection of relevant illustration art images. The primary aim is to bridge the gap between poetry and visual art, providing a streamlined method for generating illustrations that resonate with the themes and emotions encapsulated within the poetry.
